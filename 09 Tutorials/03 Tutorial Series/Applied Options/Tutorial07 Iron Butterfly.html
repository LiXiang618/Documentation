Similar to the Iron Condor, Iron Butterfly is a limited risk, limited profit trading strategy. It profits from lower volatility meaning that traders gain profits from this strategy if the stock price changes within a small range. Iron Butterfly has a more narrow range for the price to move up or down compared with Iron Condor.

From the payoff plot, the maximum gain is simply the net credit you received when you buy and sell 4 options. This occurs if the stock price is exactly the same as the strike price of ATM options. In this condition, all options expire worthless and you keep all premiums received. We can see the Iron Butterfly has more narrow structures than the Iron Condor. However, the profit can be higher than with the Iron Condor as you receive more premium by selling ATM options than OTM options.

The maximum loss occurs if the underlying price is either below the OTM put strike or above the OTM call strike. In these two conditions, two puts or two calls are exercised and the other two options expire worthless.
<h2>Implementation</h2>
Step 1: Initialize your algorithm which includes setting the start date and end date, setting the cash and implement the coarse selection of option contracts.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def Initialize(self):
	self.SetStartDate(2017, 2, 1)
	self.SetEndDate(2017, 3, 31)
	self.SetCash(300000)
	equity = self.AddEquity("GOOG", Resolution.Minute)
	option = self.AddOption("GOOG", Resolution.Minute)
	self.symbol = option.Symbol
	option.SetFilter(-10, 10, timedelta(0), timedelta(30))
	# use the underlying equity GOOG as the benchmark
	self.SetBenchmark(equity.Symbol)
</pre>
Step 2: Break the candidate contracts into the call and put options.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def TradeOptions(self,optionchain):
    for i in optionchain:
        if i.Key != self.symbol: continue
	chain = i.Value
	# filter the call and put options from the contracts
	call = [i for i in chain if i.Right == 0]
	put = [i for i in chain if i.Right == 1]
</pre>
Step 3: Sort the call and put options according to their strike price respectively. <code>option.SetFilter(-10, 10, timedelta(0), timedelta(30))</code> helps us choose 21 call options and 21 put options which expire within 30 days from now on.Then for call option, the first 10 contracts are in the money, the last 10 contracts are out of the money. The middle one is at the money option. For put options, the first 10 contracts are out of the money, the last 10 contracts are in the money.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">call_contracts = sorted(call,key = lambda x: x.Strike)
put_contracts = sorted(put,key = lambda x: x.Strike)
if len(call_contracts) == 0 or len(put_contracts) == 0 : continue
</pre>
Step 4: Find the specific contracts to trade. At the money options have the minimum absolute value of the difference between the underlying price and the strike price.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums"># Sell 1 ATM Put
self.atm_put = sorted(put_contracts,key = lambda x: abs(chain.Underlying.Price - x.Strike))[0]
self.Sell(self.atm_put.Symbol ,1)
# Sell 1 ATM Call
self.atm_call = sorted(call_contracts,key = lambda x: abs(chain.Underlying.Price - x.Strike))[0]
self.Sell(self.atm_call.Symbol ,1)
# Buy 1 OTM Call
self.otm_call = call_contracts[-1]
self.Buy(self.otm_call.Symbol ,1)
# Buy 1 OTM Put
self.otm_put = put_contracts[0]
self.Buy(self.otm_put.Symbol ,1)
</pre>
<h2>Summary</h2>
In this algorithm, on 04/03/2017, the share price of Google is $832.8. We buy OTM put(strike = $805) at $2, OTM call(strike = $860) and sell an ATM call and an ATM put. At the expiry 04/21/2017, the share price is $841.53. The ATM call is exercised and the other 3 options expire worthless. As we hold the short position of ATM call, after expiration we hold 100 short positions of GOOG stock.
