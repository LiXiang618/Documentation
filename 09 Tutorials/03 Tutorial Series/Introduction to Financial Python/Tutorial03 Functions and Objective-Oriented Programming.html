In the last tutorial we introduced logical operations, loops and list comprehension. We will introduce functions and object-oriented programming in this chapter, which will enable us to build complex algorithms in more flexible ways.

<h2>Functions</h2>

A function is a reusable block of code. We can use a function to output a value, or do anything else we want. We can easily define our own function by using the keyword "def".

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def product(x,y):
    return x*y
print product(2,3)
[out]: 6
print product(5,10)
[out]: 50
</pre>

The keyword "def" is followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented. The product() function above has "x" and "y" as its parameters. A function doesn't necessarily have parameters:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def say_hi():
    print "Welcome to QuantConnect'
say_hi()
[out]: Welcome to QuantConnect
</pre>

<h2>Built-in Function</h2>

<strong>range()</strong> is a function that creates a list containing an arithmetic sequence. It's often used in for loops. The arguments must be integers. If the "step" argument is omitted, it defaults to 1.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
print range(10)
[out]: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print range(1, 11)
[out]: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print range(1, 11, 2)
[out]: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
</pre>

<strong>len()</strong> is another function used together with range() to create a for loop. This function returns the length of an object. The argument must be a sequence or a collection.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
tickers = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'IBM', 'FB', 'F', 'V', 'G', 'GE']
print "The number of tickers is {}".format(len(tickers))
for k in range(len(tickers)):
    print k + 1, tickers[k]
[out]:
The number of tickers is 8
1 AAPL
2 GOOGL
3 IBM
4 FB
5 F
6 V
7 G
8 GE
</pre>

Note: If you want to print only the tickers without those numbers, then simply write "for ticker in tickers: print ticker"

<strong>map()</strong> is a function that applies a specific function to every item of a sequence or collection, and returns a list of the results.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">tickers = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'IBM', 'FB', 'F', 'V', 'G', 'GE']
print map(len, tickers)
[out]: [4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2]
</pre>

The <strong>lambda operator</strong> is a way to create small anonymous functions. These functions are just needed where they have been created. For example:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">map(lambda x: x**2, range(10))
[out]: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
</pre>

map() can be applied to more than one list. The lists have to have the same length.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">map(lambda x, y: x+y, [1,2,3,4,5], [5,4,3,2,1])
[out]: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
</pre>

<strong>sorted()</strong> takes a list or set and returns a new sorted list:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">sorted([5,2,3,4,1])
[out]: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</pre>

We can add a "key" parameter to specify a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons. For example:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">price_list = [('AAPL', 144.09), ('GOOGL', 911.71), ('MSFT', 69), ('FB', 150), ('WMT', 75.32)]
sorted(price_list, key = lambda x: x[1])
[out]:
[('MSFT', 69), ('WMT', 75.32), ('AAPL', 144.09), ('FB', 150), ('GOOGL', 911.71)]
</pre>

By default the values are sorted by ascending order. We can change it to descending by adding an optional parameter "reverse'.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">price_list = [('AAPL', 144.09), ('GOOGL', 911.71), ('MSFT', 69), ('FB', 150), ('WMT', 75.32)]
sorted(price_list, key = lambda x: x[1], reverse = True)
[out]:
[('GOOGL', 911.71), ('FB', 150), ('AAPL', 144.09), ('WMT', 75.32), ('MSFT', 69)]
</pre>

Lists also have a function list.sort(). This function takes the same "key" and "reverse" arguments as sorted(), but it doesn't return a new list.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">price_list = [('AAPL', 144.09), ('GOOGL', 911.71), ('MSFT', 69), ('FB', 150), ('WMT', 75.32)]
price_list.sort(key = lambda x: x[1])
print price_list
[out]:
[('MSFT', 69), ('WMT', 75.32), ('AAPL', 144.09), ('FB', 150), ('GOOGL', 911.71)]
</pre>

<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>

Python is an object-oriented programming language. It's important to understand the concept of "objects" because almost every kind of data from QuantConnect API is an object.

<h3>Class</h3>
A class is a type of data, just like a string, float, or list. When we create an object of that data type, we call it an <strong>instance</strong> of a class.

In Python, everything is an object - everything is an instance of some class. The data stored inside an object are called <strong>attributes</strong>, and the functions which are associated with the object are called <strong>methods</strong>.

For example, as mentioned above, a list is an object of the "list" class, and it has a method list.sort().

We can create our own objects by defining a class. We would do this when it's helpful to group certain functions together. For example, we define a class named "Stock" here:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">class Stock:
    def __init__(self, ticker, open, close, volume):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.open = open
        self.close = close
        self.volume = volume
        self.rate_return = float(close)/open - 1

    def update(self, open, close):
        self.open = open
        self.close = close
        self.rate_return = float(self.close)/self.open - 1

    def print_return(self):
        print self.rate_return
</pre>

The "Stock" class has attributes "ticker", "open", "close", "volume" and "rate_return". Inside the class body, the first method is called __init__, which is a special method. When we create a new instance of the class, the __init__ method is immediately executed with all the parameters that we pass to the "Stock" object. The purpose of this method is to set up a new "Stock" object using data we have provided.

Here we create two Stock objects named "apple" and "google".
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">apple  = Stock('AAPL', 143.69, 144.09, 20109375)
google = Stock('GOOGL', 898.7, 911.7, 1561616)
</pre>

Stock objects also have two other methods: update() and print_return(). We can access the attribues of a Stock object and call its methods:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">apple.ticker
[out]: 'AAPL'
google.print_return()
[out]: 0.0144653388227
google.update(912.8,913.4)
google.print_return()
[out]: 0.000657318141981
</pre>

By calling the update() function, we updated the open and close prices of a stock. Please note that when we use the attributes or call the methods <strong>inside a class</strong>, we need to specify them as self.attribute or self.method(), otherwise Python will deem them as global variables and thus raise an error.

We can add an attribute to an object anywhere:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
apple.ceo = 'Tim Cook'
apple.ceo
[out]: 'Tim Cook'
</pre>

We can check what names (i.e. attributes and methods) are defined on an object using the dir() function:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">dir(apple)
[out]:
['__doc__',
 '__init__',
 '__module__',
 'ceo',
 'close',
 'open',
 'print_return',
 'rate_return',
 'ticker',
 'update',
 'volume']
</pre>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

Inheritance is a way of arranging classes in a hierarchy from the most general to the most specific. A "child" class is a more specific type of a "parent" class because a child class will inherit all the attribues and methods of its parent. For example, we define a class named "Child" which inherits "Stock":
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">class Child(Stock):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
</pre>

Then we create an object:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">aa = Child('AA')
print aa.name
[out]: 'AA'
aa.update(100, 102)
print aa.open
[out]: 100
print aa.close
[out]: 102
print aa.print_return()
[out]: 0.02</pre>
As seen above, the new class Child has inherited the methods from Stock.

<h2>Summary</h2>

In this chapter we have introduced functions and classes. When we write a QuantConnect algorithm, we would define our algorithm as a class (QCAlgorithm). This means our algorithm inherited the QC API methods from QCAlgorithm class.

In the next chapter, we will introduce NumPy and Pandas, which enable us to conduct scientific calculations in Python.
