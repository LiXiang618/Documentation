    We provide a shortcut to set common models and properties relating to each of the brokerages we support. These
    brokerage models set fees, fill models, slippage models and trading markets for a brokerage. In addition they
    validate it is possible to submit trades to the brokerage (e.g. submitting equity trades to a forex only brokerage).

    This gives you enormous control over your algorithm behavior and allow you to model virtually any brokerage in the
    world.

    In addition to our default brokerage model ($[DefaultBrokerageModel]), we provide brokerage models for Interactive
    Brokers ($[InteractiveBrokersBrokerageModel]) , FXCM ($[FxcmBrokerageModel]), OANDA ($[OandaBrokerageModel]) and
    Tradier ($[TradierBrokerageModel]).

    Brokerage models override any other models you may set for a security.
