	We provide a powerful charting API which can be build many chart types. At its simplest it can be used with a single line of code:<div class="section-example-container"><pre class="csharp">Plot("Series Name", value);</pre><pre class="python">Plot("Series Name", value)</pre></div>
</p>
<p>
	With this code a line-graph is added underneath your <i>Strategy Equity</i> chart and your requested values are displayed over time. To create a new chart (new tab) you should also specify the chart name in your request:<div class="section-example-container"><pre class="csharp">Plot("My Indicators", "EMA", ema);</pre></div>
</p>
<p>
	Behind the scenes these methods create a new $[Chart] object and add it to your algorithm, and then add a new $[Series] object to that chart. A chart is made from many series. You can also initialize your charts manually to get more control over their look and feel.
